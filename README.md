# Disclaimer
Hello, this is a mod menu template from LGL's and KolanHacker(Hard-Android-Menu), a version with SubMenus now.

I just improved the menu a bit to make it more readable and easier to modify.

# ARM64 DISCLAIMER!
For some reason arm64 does not work. If anyone could pull an issue to fix this, it will be all good.

For now, this template supports armv-7
